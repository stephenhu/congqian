cong qian, 从前, a long time ago/once upon a time, warring states

a historical mmorpg based in ancient china during the warring states
from 481-221 BC.

the world of cong qian is immersive, rich, and filled with opportunities and adventures for each player, the choices you make can alter the entire path in the game.  this will be set in a fictional time period in china during the seven kingdoms, each of the kingdoms are at war with each other.  players can choose their own path like joining an army, becoming a merchant or artisan, working in government, becoming a street beggar, or an outlaw.

the world should be alive and with variations to make things more realistic and each experience unique.  for example, in congqian, not all horses will be the same speed, there are fast horses and there are slow horses, having a way to distinguish will make the game play more interesting.  some trees will produce stronger lumber and it will be up to the players to explore and find these types of resources.  typically a game will rely on respawning resources like a cow to give others an opportunity to fulfill the same quest which does not model the real world, the world becomes a static representation.  in congqian if you use up all the resources, you'll need to find somewhere else with resources.  this provides an added dimension for players, you could entirely spend time just chopping wood in the world to become the top lumber producer, or you could focus on war and fighting if that's what you enjoy.  this freedom of choice provides the game with multiple modes of play, but altogether, each player contribues to the world and the direction.

intially there will be a set of events that get the game started, events will be added to the world by editors and eventually by the players, but many of the decisions and outcomes made by players will affect the history and transgression of the world, this will be updated in the game's news which will also be an evolving and a living element of the game, in other words, the world is changing constantly, it is not a fixed world.  the hope is that in a few months time, the world will have completely changed or diverged from the original intention of the editors, though the editors will always have the opportunity to play the "god of hand" and alter the direction of the world to balance or add more interesting manifestations of the game.
