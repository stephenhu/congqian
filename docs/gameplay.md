# game play

Game play will be free and open, there will be many other players to interact with in a massive world.  in the world, each adventurer can choose his or her path, there will be different lifestyles, roles, abilities.

## basic game play

* the main objective in cong qian is to earn wealth, prestige, and/or ranking, one could easily choose to focus on just wealth, for example, and become a merchart in a city, or join the army or government, this is achieved through quests, increasing skills, and sometimes pure luck
* secondary objectives could be exploring the virtual world, adventure and social elements.
* each player has a set of innate skills drawn randomly, as you interact with the world, certain skills will be enhanced, like if you chop trees, your strength, agility, health, etc will increase
* i don't believe in tech trees as these require too much coordination, i want players to interact with the world, less so choosing special abilities, it's the interactions that specializes these characters, not choosing how to upgrade
* battle should be pretty straightforward and easy, think of button mashing
* i don't really want fantasy skills like magic or lightning bolts, i guess this can be decided later on, but for now, i just want realistic things like swords, bow and arrow, etc
* character classes will emerge, but players are not really type cast into 
a certain class forever, you change classes, but there shouldn't be a designation really.  classic rpg games have wizards, warriors, thieves, clerics, but you can have all these abilities, the way you interact with the world enhances each of these abilities.
* i think the differentiation of this world is really about how players
interact with each other.  imagine a scenario where characters band together
and their job is to rob others.  however, this will have repercussions as the law will try to subdue you by issuing riches to recruit able bodied soldiers to capture you.
* although there will be several plots and stories in the game, i like the ability of having fewer of these and more natural interactions between characters.  there will be some overall prevailing stories from season to season such as wars between countries or natural disasters, but for the most part, more of the stories will be created between players, this creates a lighter weight or need for story writers to provide all game play content, naturally game play will be dictated by what players want to happen.
* each player will randomly be inserted into a role, roles have designated
obligations, this can be anything from street beggar to merchant, to king.
initially the higher roles will not be available and npc driven?  with each
role players will have a certain set of jobs or obligations, like beggars
will be obligated to eat, kings will require collecting taxes, protecting
against enemies, improving cities, feeding the people.
* social interaction is the utmost importance as users need to be able to
band together to accomplish objectives.

## world

* the world will host many players, but not all thrown into a single map.
* having too many objects on the map can be confusing and cause complexity for players, so there's no need to fill the map with density.
* the world will be large and filled with natural boundaries like mountains, seas, and rivers to keep different players apart.  when you add friends, then they can join with you in the same map, there should be some finite limit to the number of players playing together which will be based on the sustainability of the backend server.
* as things are built like bridges and buildings, there will be a decay rate at which point there needs to be maintenance.  roads need to be repaired or they wither, but throughout the history of the game, these things will change.

## players

players will have random attributes upon creation, each action triggers increase or decrease in certain attributes.  if you kill innocent people, you will decrease certain attributes which could prevent you from getting certain jobs.

## country

you are free to go from country to country to explore the vast world, but each change will come with a certain cost in terms of lost attributes, wealth, fame, etc.

## requirements

* there should be the ability to join parties, to play together with groups of friends, this should be a primary goal.

## sample roles

Everyone has a choice as to how they interact with the world by choosing an occupation, occupations can be changed freely, though certain occupations will require opportunity and a certain level of skill or luck.  an example would be a government official, not everyone can become this, so you would have to build up your intelligence to a certain level to be eligible, there would also need to be an opening available.  The idea is not to restrict a certain style of game for players, if you enjoy fighting, you can become a soldier, if you like administration, you could join the government, if you like earning wealth then you could become a merchant.  this flexibility will allow players the ability to interact with the world in many different ways or if you just want a single play mode, that is fine as well.

Everyone has a part in molding a village or city whether it be from a personal hut to a palace building.  These buildings will persist over time, they could be toppled with war.  The world could be completely different after each season based on player behavior, for example, one kingdom could be toppled by another with cities devastated and populations ransacked.

* a carpenter helps to build parts of the city like bridges, palaces, huts
* a lumberjack chops trees to be sold or manufactured into logs, lumber
* soliders can train to increase fighting abilities
* a beggar could explore the city in search of food and water

There will need to be a little bit of definition surrounding roles so that there's more structure to it in terms of game play, for example, as a beggar
you wouldn't want the whole game play to be receiving charity and theft, there would need to be skills that could be upgraded like ways of theft that
could help attributes to increase which could lead to opportunities later on. 


## achieving rank

initially high ranking officials for each kingdom will be managed by the game to make things generally fair, since decisions made at this level will
affect all the players in the kingdom, for example, if taxes were raised to 80% then a lot of players would suffer from advancing attributes.  over time
this control can be given to players as an incentive to play the game longer.
