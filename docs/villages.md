# villages

villages will not be named, typically less than 300 people.  there will be no government or military in villages though the jurisdiction will be that of the kingdom so taxation, military draft, etc will be imparted on villages.

everyone will be on equal ground within the village, infrastructure and resources will be limited, perhaps some villages will be close to resources like mining operations.
